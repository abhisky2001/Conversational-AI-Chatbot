# Conversational-AI-Chatbot

## Inspiration
The project is a chatbot, built as a tool for Shellhacks 2021 Sponsor, AutoNation's Customer Service. 

## What it does
The project aims to automate frequently asked questions that can be asked to automotive dealers, schedule servicing appointments and register purchase orders. 

## How it was built
The project is built using Dialogflow and integrated to Telegram for easy and free access. NodeJS was used to make some changes and GitHub was used to store the project (intentions). 

## Challenges we ran into
Since this is my first hackathon, it took time to familiarize with the technology an it's usage. But, it was a great learning opportunity for me to familiarize with the chatbot. If I had a little more time, I could've integrated some extra feature that I had initially thought of like obtaining customer info and data retrieval by integrating with a database etc. 

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
It was a great learning opportunity. I got to learn Dialogflow and how to use Google Cloud Services. I have added responses so that the user feels almost as if talking to a real person and not a chatbot. 

## What's next for AutoBot
Integrating with a Database like Firestore and using some form of authentication to let customers create and set up a profile and retrieve previous orders and requests.
